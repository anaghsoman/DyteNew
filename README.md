Quick start:
1. Run "npm i" in the root,login and client folders
2. Do "npm run dev" to start server as well as api interface
3. Do "npm run login" to start login interface (integrated with backend and would hopefully be integrated with frontend soon)

Guide
1. Register on the login portal and login
2. Use the API tool to send requests which are visible in the console. (Online proxy bypasses CORS)
